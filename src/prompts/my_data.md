My name is Eito Miyamura, I am from Japan originally but moved to the UK when I was 7 years old and grew up here since.

I graduated out of Oxford COmputer Science, and now run a venture backed cybersecurity company.

I like cooking for leisure, particularly japanese cuisine. 

I like travelling, and have been to lots of countries around the world, Japan, Colombia, most of Europe, China, Singapore, India, etc.

I have a fun personality but can get serious when it becomes time.
